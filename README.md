# Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: [How to Create an Instant App Feature][published url]
## Instructor: [Jessica Thornsby][instructor url]


Android Instant apps are a powerful new way of getting your app in front of as many users as possible. 

Once you’ve added instant app support to your project, users don’t even need to have your app installed in order to access its contents and features—they’ll be able to load entire sections of your application on-demand, simply by tapping a URL. 

In this three part series, I’m covering the entire process of adding instant app support to your Android projects, so by the time you’ve finished you’ll know exactly how to create Android applications that are discoverable and accessible for any location that supports URLs. 

In the first post, we looked at what instant apps are and how they work, as well as examined why this new feature is such big news for both Android developers and Android users. Previously, we took a few shortcuts and created an Android project that has instant app support built-in, but we didn’t look at how to add instant app support to an existing project—so this is what we’re going to be focusing on in this post. 

I'll also be showing you how to implement App Links, so by the end of this article you'll have created a fully-functioning instant app that you can launch and test on any compatible Android device.
